          My <em>favorite</em> thing about programming is being creative and
          problem solving.

          I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. I have a 10-month-old Germand
          Shepherd and Husky puppy that drives me crazy. I joined the software
          development bootcamp because I've always been moderately computer
          literate and can see myself pursuing a career in this field. In my
          free time, I love watching movies, playing farming simulation games,
          building keyboards, and maybe paint from time to time.
