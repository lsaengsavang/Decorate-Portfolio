  <p>
    I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. I have a German
    Shepherd and Husky puppy that drives me crazy. I joined the software
    development bootcamp because I've always been moderately computer
    literate and can see myself pursuing a career in this field. I love to watch movies, play farming simulation games,
    build keyboards, and maybe paint from time to time.
